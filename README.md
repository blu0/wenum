# WEnum
Windows Enumeration using Golang

Uses file.txt (must be in same directory) to read and execute commands line by line.  
Edit file.txt and add additional commands as needed.

Compiled exe is available, or compile the main.go file yourself (go build -o wenum.exe)

Will list out each result on Command Line, or you can send to file (wenum.exe > results.txt)
